# **Brazilian E-commerce**

## **Backgrounds**

1. Sales
The dataset received from the Sales team is in the form of a database containing information about the user id, the order they made, the order status, reviews, and others. From this large database, came up questions such as:
    - How can we measure monthly sales or orders?
    - What products contribute the most to profit?
    - Where do our customers come from?
    - How are the reviews from customers?
    - What needs to be improved from the product?
    - What are the sales predictions in the future?

2. Marketing
From the Marketing department, we get data on the number of users who interact with the marketing campaigns that have been carried out, their activities on our website, the total purchases made, as well as demographics of year of birth, educational background, marital status, and income level. From these data, we want to be able to answer
    - How is our market look like? Like what are they who often make purchases?
    - How about customers' habits?
    - How about metrics such as rate of review, web conversion rate per campaign, customer profile based on certain purchases, etc.

3. Business Development
At the BizDev(Business Development) team, they need the help of the BI team in their experiment to test the effectiveness of our website's new landing page. This test is done by A/B testing. The data obtained are in the form of random assignment of users who visit the website as control (get an old page) or treatment user (get a new page) and the conversion rate of these visits to sales. We want to answer questions like
    - Should we change the current website landing page?
    - Are the tests carried out valid to be used as the basis for making decisions?

## **Objectives**
- To help monitoring the main activities of sales performance so as to facilitate strategic & operational decision making.
- To help in analyzing and monitoring the feedback given from customers of the quality of products and services provided to customers.
- To help users in analyzing marketing campaigns that have been done and to help users in knowing customer segmentation based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
- Inform the results of the A/B testing to help make decisions to change the landing page or not.
